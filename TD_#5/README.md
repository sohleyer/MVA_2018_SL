## Assignment details
**The goal of this assignment is to understand the current state of the art in machine translation.**

Use whichever (freely available) machine translation system (e.g. Google Translate) to investigate the following questions:

- Which syntactic constructions are correctly translated? Which ones are not? Can you guess why?
- What about questions, long and/or complex sentences, sentences in the first person, idioms (_kick the bucket_ vs. _casser sa pipe_), named entities (_London_)…
- What is the influence of the language pair? Cf. English<->French vs. English<->Chinese or English<->(a rare language)
- What is the influence of the context. E.g., how are the following discourse translated (English <-> French):
      - (en>fr) _A mouse appeared. It looked hungry._
      - (fr>en) _Il aime bien le mouton. Surtout les côtelettes de mouton._
